Problem Description
-------------------

The task is to implement a distribution system that handles user requests to
store and retrieve data. The distribution system must write and read data from
'blocks' using the provided system calls declared in datablock.h. There are a
finite number of blocks (NUM_DATA_BLOCKS) that can be used to store data. Each
block has a finite number of writes (BLOCK_MAX_WRITES) that it can handle. Each
time data is written to a block, a usage is consumed and any existing data is
overwritten with the new data. Once BLOCK_MAX_WRITES writes have been written to
a block, that block can no longer be used. Blocks are addressed by an 'index' that
ranges from 0 to NUM_DATA_BLOCKS - 1.

The provided system calls in datablock.h are:

write_data_block()  - Writes data to a specific block index.
read_data_block()   - Reads data from a specific block index.
get_write_counter() - retrieves the write count for a specific block.

reset_data_blocks() - Resets all block write counts and data; Used only for
                      testing. Do not use to increase the number of writes that
                      can be achieved.
dump_blocks()       - Prints the write count and and data for all blocks. Used
                      for testing and debugging.

The distribution system must be implemented by you in the distribution.c file.
Commands from the user come in the form of a single 64-bit value and must be
parsed and handled in the process_command() function. Each bit in the command has
the following meaning:

Bits
 0-2    Command type. CMD_WRITE is a write, CMD_READ is a read.
 3-9    User index to read or write. This index ranges from 0 to NUM_DATA_BLOCKS - 1.
10-41   32-bit user data. For write commands this data must written to a block. For
        read commands these bits must be filled with the data read from the block.
42-63   Not used.

Note: in your implementation, the user index does not necessarily have to map
to the same block index. The functions you must implement in distribution.c are:

initialize()      - One time initialization called at the beginning of main.
reset()           - Resets the distribution system between tests, can be called
                    multiple times. Uses reset_data_blocks() to reset the blocks.
process_command() - Proccesses all read and write requests from the user.

You may implement additional functions only in distribution.c if needed. The other
.c and .h files should not be modified.

------------------------
Example of user requests
------------------------

Write data 0xA to index 0 | command = 0x2802
Write data 0xB to index 0 | command = 0x2C02
Write data 0xC to index 1 | command = 0x300A
...
Read index 0 | command = 0x1 | should return data 0xB, command == 0x2C01
Read index 1 | command = 0x9 | should return data 0xC, command == 0x3009

----------------
Grading criteria
----------------

The success of the system is measured by the maximum number of writes that can
be processed before blocks are used up, and the ability to preserve the data
written. The program must compile using GCC 4.x or later (see below for
installation options) and run without crashing.

Bounds of the problem:
* Write commands must result in data stored into a block using the function
  write_data_block(), which cannot be modified.
* Data cannot be stored in memory other than using the write_data_block()
  function. For example, don't malloc memory to store data so the system can
  handle more writes.
* Do not modify anything in the datablock.h/c, or distribution.h files
* You may add additional types or internal functions as needed in order to
  optimize your implementation in distribution.c
* You may add additional tests to main.c in order to check your implementation.
  2 example tests are given to check basic functionality of your code.
* We want to see what you can code, not the open-source community. Do not use
  Boost or other external libraries to implement algorithms or pre-built data
  structures. Using the standard C99 library and types are OK.

Your tasks:
* Implement the initialize(), reset(), and process_command() functions according
  to the system description above. Implement any other internal functions or
  types as required in order to meet the requirements. Descriptions of the
  required parameters and return values are included as part of the comments
  above the function declarations in distribution.c
* Implement your tests in the given main() function after calling initialize()
* Include comments as necessary to understand your code.

------------------
Compiling with GCC
------------------

You must use GCC version 4.x or higher. The command line to compile your program
is below:

gcc -o distribution distribution.c datablock.c main.c

* For Linux/Unix typically no install is required on these systems. Ensure that
  the GCC version on your system is 4.x or higher
* For Windows the TDM GCC package is recommended and easy to install.

  You are free to use Cygwin or other package that supports GCC.
